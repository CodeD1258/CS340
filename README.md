I focused on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code by organizing the CRUD Python module into clear methods for database operations. This modular approach made it easy to connect the dashboard to MongoDB, reduce errors, and reuse the module in future projects.

When tackling this project, I broke the requirements into manageable steps—designing queries, filtering data, and building interactive Dash components, while keeping user needs in mind. This combined back-end and front-end work, which differed from previous assignments that were more isolated.

Computer scientists turn data into actionable insights, and this dashboard demonstrates that impact. By making Grazioso Salvare’s data easier to explore and analyze, staff can quickly identify animals for specific rescue types and make informed decisions, improving efficiency and outcomes.
